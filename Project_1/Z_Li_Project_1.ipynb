    "This project is to analyze the dataset comprised of information pertaining to NY State High School graduation metrics for the 2018-2019 school year. Our goal is to develop one or more regression models to predict the number of dropouts in a school district or for a specific group of students. This prediction will be based on a variety of characteristics related to district characteristics, student groupings, and possibly other relevant factors such as socioeconomic status of students, geographic location of the district, school resources and capacity, etc. \n",

    "In short, we will apply the full data science project lifecycle to the implementation and evaluation of a series of regression models that predict the number of student “dropouts” relative to certain properties/characteristics of a given school district and associated student subgrouping. \n"

    "### 1.1 Approach\n",
    "Here are the steps:\n",
    "- __Exploratory Data Analysis:__ Get a better understanding of the dataset and variables.\n",
    "- __Data Preparation:__ Process the data to correct the data quality problems and use feature selection to create new attributes combining the domain knowledge.\n",
    "- __Prepped Data Review:__ Re-run the EDA by prepped data to check if the variables are ready to be used in our model building.\n",
    "- __Regression Model and Evaluation:__ Build the model in different ways and evaluate.\n",
    "- __Model Selection:__ Show the model selection criteria based on the model performance.\n",
    "- __Conclusion:__ Clearly state our summary and conclusion we can get after analyzing"
